# Benchmark Languages
Speed comparison b/w languages

## Warning
Time shown is time taken for language environment to start + the actual time taken for execution.

Soon, it'll only count the time taken just by the algorithm. Untill then, python will do better than js.

## Example
```
c:          0.003
c++:        0.003
php:        0.058
c#:         0.060
python:     0.107
js:         0.167
java:       0.378
bash:       2.905
```
