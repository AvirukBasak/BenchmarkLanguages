# Benchmark Languages
Speed comparison b/w languages

## Warning
Time shown is time taken for language environment to start + the actual time taken for execution.

Soon, it'll only count the time taken just by the algorithm. Untill then, JavaScript will do better than python.

## Example
```
c:      0.003
c++:        0.003
php:        0.058
c#:     0.066
python:     0.116
js:     0.182
java:       0.379
